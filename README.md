# Online-Retail-Analytics
## Project Description

This project analyzes transactional data from an online retail store to understand revenue trends, customer behavior, and geographic performance. Using real-world sales records, the analysis focuses on how revenue evolves over time, which countries and customers generate the most value, and how product demand varies across regions.

The dataset is cleaned to remove cancellations, missing customer records, and invalid transactions before calculating revenue from quantity and unit price. The project combines Python-based data preparation with business intelligence tools to produce clear, decision-focused insights for leadership.

The goal of this project is to move beyond raw sales numbers and identify the customers, regions, and time periods that truly drive business performance.
