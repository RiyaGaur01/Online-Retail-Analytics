# Online-Retail-Analytics
This project analyzes transactional data from an online retail store to understand revenue trends, customer behavior, and geographic performance. Using real-world sales records, the analysis focuses on how revenue evolves over time, which countries and customers generate the most value, and how product demand varies across regions.
